# Working with Sentinel 2 data

This repo is for a lecture on working with Sentinel 2 data in TEK4710 at ITS, UiO.

We will go through how to download Sentinel 2 data using the Copernicus Browser, visualise the data, and calculate the normalized difference vegetation index. 

## Preparation before class

If you are a participant in that course, you should bring a laptop to class. You will also need to have a Google account and a Copernicus Data Space account. 

I would like you to create an account on the Copernicus Data Space before class, if at all possible.

### How to create a Copernicus Data Space account

[Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/) is the platform that distributes the data from European Space Agency's satellites. 

In order to download data from Copernicus, you have to create a user account. To do this, you click on the Register button here: [Sign in to Copernicus Data Space Ecosystem](https://identity.dataspace.copernicus.eu/auth/realms/CDSE/protocol/openid-connect/auth?client_id=cdse-public&response_type=code&scope=openid&redirect_uri=https%3A//dataspace.copernicus.eu/account/confirmed/1), fill out the form and hit Register. (If anyone has used the old Open Access Hub and had an account there, this is not the same platform, so you will need to register here.) 

## During the class

The lecture and the exercises are in a single Jupyter Notebook. To avoid you having to install anything on your machine, it's set up to be run in Google Colab. 

This means you need a Google account (sorry about that), and we will also use Google Drive to store some data. 

You can open the notebook directly in Google Colab.
